# VBA-challenge
VBA-challenge Week Two Module- "NEW READ ME" BRANCH is the correct branch for this assignment.
Xpert Learning Assistant aided me in learning the .row function included withing a cell specification rather than the absolute ways we went over in class, the learning assistant taught me the ability to do x.Cells(y.Row,1) to find a value in a different column of the same row as y, i.e. in column x. We did not go over this specifically in class, stating to honor code source.
